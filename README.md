### **Short description of the project:**
 
My project is interactive React-based cricket team management app. Users can view available players, select them based on their bidding price, and manage their choices within a set budget. With a clean design and Tailwind CSS styling, it features a toggle for viewing either available or selected players and a live notification system for successful actions. The interface is responsive and easy to navigate, ideal for cricket fans looking to simulate team management!

### **My project utilizes the following technologies:**

- React.

- Tailwind CSS.

- React Toastify.

- PropTypes.

- React Icons.

- Surge

### **Three key features of this project:**

**1. Dynamic Player Selection:** Users can view available players and select them based on their credit balance. Each player's profile displays details like name, country, role, and bidding price, adding realism to the selection process.

**2. Interactive Credit System:** The app includes a credit system, where users earn additional credits and spend them to "bid" for players. Notifications inform users if they lack sufficient credits or if a player is already selected, enhancing usability.

**3. Toggle Between Views:** A toggle feature allows users to switch between viewing available players and their selected team, with an "Add More Players" option that redirects to available players when needed, ensuring seamless navigation.
